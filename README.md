# automated-website-opener
If you've got a file with a long list of website URLs, this script will automatically open them for you, saving you clicks and effort. 

While various bulk URL openers exist on the Chrome Web Store, this one is open source and customizable in that it allows you to add tasks you wish to automate once each URL is opened.

Automation is handled using Selenium and chromedriver.

Requirements:
- pip
- Selenium
- Up-to-date Chrome installation

NOTE: While a up-to-date Chrome installation is required, chromedriver itself is *not* required. The Python script will automatically download the latest chromedriver.
